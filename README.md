# Instagram-Bot
A bot that does automatic user-login and liking of Instagram posts of a selected user.

## Requirements

* Python Selenium package (pip3 install selenium)
  
* geckodriver (selenium webdriver for Firefox) as per your current Firefox version, if using firefox

* chromedriver (selenium webdriver for Chrome) as per your current Google Chrome version, if using chrome(note that you would have to modify the source code a bit. I guess you are smart enough to figure that out.)
   
## USING THE SCRIPT:

- python3 Instagram.py

- Enter your email-id, password, and the username of the person whose posts you want to like.
  The default script currently does login via Facebook; you may uncomment a certain piece of the code to       enable login without Facebook

- Happy 'Liking'. Note, however,that Instagram has a limit on the number of posts you can like every hour. So use the script wisely !
